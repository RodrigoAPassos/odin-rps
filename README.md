"We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic 'rock paper scissors'. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.

Now that we can manipulate the DOM, it’s time to revisit Rock Paper Scissors and add a simple UI to it."

Finished this project for now, the ui was inspired in whatsapp as you can see (i imagine XD).
